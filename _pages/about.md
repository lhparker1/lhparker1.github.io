I am a predoctoral researcher at the Flatiron Institute in New York City, where I am a part of the <a href="https://polymathic-ai.org">Polymathic AI</a> collaboration and the Center for Computational Astrophysics. Previously, I completed my B.A. magna cum laude in Physics from Princeton University. 

I am broadly interested in the applications of deep learning in physics and astrophysics. Currently, my research focuses on two main directions. First, I work on developing foundation models tailored for numerical datasets and scientific machine learning tasks. Second, I develop forward modeling approaches that combine cosmological simulations with deep-learning backed Bayesian inference for constraining cosmology from galaxy clustering.
